//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.

    let movies = ['Black Widow','Black Panter','Men in Black']

//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable

    let firtsMovie = movies[0]

//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable

    let arrLength = movies.length
    console.log(arrLength)    

//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. 
//What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?


    let lastMovie = movies [ movies.length - 1 ]
